        <h1>My favourite films</h1>
        <h2>A little bit about the "best films of all time"</h2>
        <p>
            An honest list of some of my favourite films, in order. This list is compiled based on how much I personally enjoy the films. <br />
            It is not a 'best films of all time' list, though many of them I would consider to be worthy contenders.
        </p>
        <p>
            When compiling a 'favourite' films list, I tend to find people are often too conscious that the list is to be presented or shown to <br />
            others, which distorts the truth and results in a compilation designed to impress or disguise actual preference.
        </p>
        <p>
            This list does no such thing, and contains guilty pleasures, childhood favourites, overlooked obscurities, world cinema greats, <br />
            classics and a number of films that shout "quite frankly, dear, I don't give a damn!". After about 6 years of this list's <br />
            existence, I have abandoned my rule of having to have seen the film at least twice, and have added an additional 150 titles to form <br />
            a more comprehensive, varied collection of the films I adore.
